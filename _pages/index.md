- Mentor MSc students through hands-on labs using AWS, PySpark, and Databricks, enhancing practical understanding of scalable data workflows.
- Develop lab sheets and teaching materials in collaboration with module leaders, increasing student engagement and enhancing course feedback scores by 15%.

### Big Data Engineer  
**IQVIA, Bangalore, India**  
_Jun 2022 – Aug 2023_

- Built scalable ETL pipelines using Apache Spark and Airflow on Microsoft Azure to process over millions of patient records weekly, achieving 99.8% reliability across production environments and supporting downstream data applications.
- Automated Hadoop cluster clean-up using Bash scripts and Airflow DAGs, reducing manual intervention and cutting recurring job failures by 40%, which significantly improved workflow stability on shared infrastructure.
- Optimised and developed Spark jobs by upgrading the codebase from Scala 2 to Scala 3 and refactoring inefficient transformations, mitigating pipeline runtime from 12 to 8 hours and lowering shared cluster compute costs.
- Resolved over 10 high-priority production incidents through root cause analysis and team collaboration, cutting incident response time by 50% and boosting documentation knowledge base via JIRA and Confluence.
- Engineered Spark SQL workflows and optimised joins and partitioning to process multi-terabyte patient datasets, transforming raw data into reporting-ready tables and ensuring 95%+ accuracy in automated stakeholder reports.

### Machine Learning Engineer  
**CDAC, Pune, India**  
_Oct 2021 – Jun 2022_

- Delivered an interactive NLP analytics dashboard using Django and Python, integrating named-entity-recognition, topic modelling, and word clouds enabling domain experts to analyse faster and reduce manual review time by over 60%.
- Fine-tuned multilingual transformer models using Hugging Face and PyTorch for chatbot under the Kanthasth project, improving response accuracy by 30% based on internal evaluation metrics.
- Created a user-friendly Streamlit interface to evaluate 10+ translation models, simplifying file-based input and cutting validation time for non-technical testers by 80%.
- Spearheaded onboarding peers, accelerating onboarding through structured knowledge transfer on NLP tools like spaCy and scikit-learn, coding standards, and workflow practices, streamlining their integration into the team.
