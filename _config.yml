  I am a results-driven Data Scientist and Big Data Engineer with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. With an MSc in Data Science from the University of Sheffield and hands-on experience in machine learning, big data, and cloud computing, I specialize in building scalable AI solutions, deploying production-ready ML models, and designing robust data pipelines.

  I am Microsoft Azure-certified (DP-100) and have worked on projects spanning NLP, time-series forecasting, and deep learning, delivering high-impact solutions in healthcare, finance, and analytics. My expertise in Python, Spark, AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines enables me to bridge the gap between data science and engineering, ensuring end-to-end solutions that drive business growth.

  With experience as a Big Data Engineer at IQVIA and a Machine Learning Engineer at CDAC, I have developed high-performance data pipelines, optimized machine learning workflows, and improved platform reliability. Currently, as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Sheffield, I mentor students in Big Data Analytics, AWS, and Databricks, fostering the next generation of data professionals.

  I thrive in solving real-world challenges using data, continuously learning and leveraging the latest advancements in AI, GenAI, and LLMs. Letâ€™s connect and explore how data-driven strategies can make a difference!
